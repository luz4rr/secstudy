This first **post** will not talk about cybersecurity, i'll write about *me* and the *path* i follow to give you some context.I'm a noob with **MarkDown**, so my posts should improve later on. If you have any questions, join the Discord server. You'll find a dedicated channel for each post.

#### I'm **French** and i'm in my twenties without *any* degree. Most, if not **all**, of my skills ware learned through **self-study**. That's why i'm starting this blog, to see how far i can go in cyber with self-teaching. That’s why i’m starting this blog, to see how far i can go in cyber with self-teaching. My academic background was a mix of science and art, like being an engineer and a graphic designer... what a bad mix! I've never been able to make a choice; I often change my  mind. Getting back to hacking, I've always been interested in it, at least since I got my first computer. I just never went into it in depth; I simply dived into hardware by assembling and disassembling computers. Honestly, I always thought this path was reserved for others, for computer experts.
	
#### If one thing had to define me, it would be that I love the learning process; whatever the subject, I really like to learn. Below are some examples of my personal projects, including one in progress (the writer-deck). For all these projects, I know I could simply buy them ready-made. But if I make them myself, the process will teach me more.

#### Today, I have more time so I want to try to learn cybersecurity. To do this, I'm going back to the basics of computer science and networks, starting with Comptia's ITF+.(or Tech+ today).At the same time, I enrolled in an equivalency program for the French baccalaureate (DAEU) so that I can resume my higher education if needed. After much research, I've concluded that you need a good foundation to start. I could play CTFs with write-ups to try and understand, but I'm not sure I'd go deep enough into the subject to truly grasp it...

#### To conclude this first post, I'd like to ask for your opinion on a good method for learning cybersecurity, for example, by sharing your own learning journey or giving me some advice based on your experience. You can also provide me with roadmaps and resources such as websites or blogs to better understand the concepts. To do this, I invite you to join my Discord server where you can also ask me questions, as I can't add a comment section to a static website. I'll be happy to answer you. See you in my next post. Thank you for reading.

This first **post** will not talk about cybersecurity, i'll write about *me* and the *path* i follow to give you some context.
I'm a noob with **MarkDown**, so my posts should improve later on. If you have any questions, join the Discord server. You'll find a dedicated channel for each post.

# "to start"
  I'm **French** and i'm in my twenties without *any* degree. Most, if not **all**, of my skills ware learned through **self-study**. That's why i'm starting this blog, to see how far i can go in cyber with self-teaching.
